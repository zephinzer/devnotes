# Basic Fn Application Structure
This is an example project for an Fn serverless application.

Before running anything in here, make sure you've a local Fn deployment. Instructions can be found in the [`deployment` directory](../../../deployment).

To check if everything is up correctly, run:

```bash
docker stack services fn
```

All rows should have `1/1` in the `REPLICAS` column.

You should also have `fn` installed.

For OS X:

```bash
brew update && brew install fn;
```

For other Linux-based systems:

```bash
curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install | sh
```

## Directory Structure

### `./scripts`
This directory contains scripts which can be used in a Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy code.

### `./src`
Each directory in `./src` is one independently deployable function.

### `./test`
This directory contains examples of the various types of application-level verification we can do for applications built on a serverless architecture. Function-level verification is done in the function directory itself, and will be covered below.
