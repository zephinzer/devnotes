# Developing `Fn` Applications
This directory contains examples with exercises to understand how Fn works.

- [`basic-application`](./examples/basic-application)

Before starting, the following tools are assumed to have been installed:

**Docker**
> Check it with `command -v docker`

**Docker Compose**
> Check it with `command -v docker-compose`

**Fn CLI**
> Check it with `command -v fn`

You should also have already deployed a local single-node cluster with Fn from the [`deployment` directory](../.../deployment/docker).
