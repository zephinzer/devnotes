# Hello World in Golang

## Pre-requisites
See the [Setting up Go README.md](../../_setup/README.md) to get started.

## What's Covered
A basic hello world in Golang! See the source code at [`./hello_world.go`](./hello_world.go).

Build it with:

```bash
go build hello_world.go
```

You should now be able to run it with:

```bash
./hello_world.go
```

## Learnings

- The package name must be namd `main`. `go build` will fail silently otherwise.
