# Journey in Golang

So I started my journey in Golang on 7th January 2018. This is a collection of my notes and example applications to prove my understanding of Golang to myself.

The [`./language` directory](./language) contains code demonstrating language semantics.

The [`./application` directory](./application) contains implementation of concepts and other higher level things one can cover with Golang.
