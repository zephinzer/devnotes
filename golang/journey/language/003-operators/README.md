# Operators in Golang

## Pre-requisites
See the [Setting up Go README.md](../../_setup/README.md) to get started.

## What's Covered
See the source code at [`./branch-if-else.go`](./branch-if-else.go).

Covered are:

## Learnings

- `d++` is an invalid expression, it's a statement unlike in other C-like languages
  - And so is `d+=1` and other state modifying stuff
- There is no pre-increment in Golang (ie `++d` is invalid)
